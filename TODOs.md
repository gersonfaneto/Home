# TODOs

- [_] Clean up things and add/improve documentation.

- [_] Rewrite the installation script in `C`.

  - For this, we must be able to:

    - Parse and validate command line arguments.
    - Manipulate files and directories.
    - Spawn and watch over external processes.

  - All of this will be implemented in small libraries under
    `@caffeinehq`.

- [_] Start building and including thing from `@minimalhq`.
