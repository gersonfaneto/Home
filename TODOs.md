# TODOs

- [_] Rewrite the installation script for in `C`.

    - For this, we must be able to:

        - Parse and validate command line arguments.
        - Manipulate files and directories.
        - Spawn and watch over external processes.

    - All of this will be implemented in small libraries under
    `@caffeinehq`.

- [_] Clean up things and add/improve documentation.

- [_] Start building and including thing from `@minimalhq`.
